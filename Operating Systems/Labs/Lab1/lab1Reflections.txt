The goal of the activity was to familiarize ourselves with the Linux Mint OS and some of its terminal commands through installation and initial setup of a computer as we will be studying the Linux kernel during the semester. Personally, I have installed various flavors of the Linux OS onto both my personal computers and virtual machines running on them numerous times in the past few years so the lab activity was fairly routine for me.
