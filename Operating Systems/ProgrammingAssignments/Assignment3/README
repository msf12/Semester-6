To run (where # = the number of the task):
$ javac MemoryManager.java
$ java MemoryManager path/to/file

Used separate classes to help keep things organized.
Used nested classes in place of structs.
Used many potentially unecessary variables to make managing and tracking various data easier in the rather quickly written code.
Focused more on functionality than efficiency.
