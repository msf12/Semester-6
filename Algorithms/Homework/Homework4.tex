\paragraph{\Large 1. Final 2008 Midterm Question 9}\mbox{}\\
Could not find a question 9 in the 2008 midterm exams.

\paragraph{\Large 2. Study Guide Question}\mbox{}\\
Give a worst case and best case input for insertion sort and selection sort.\\

Selection sort takes about as long to run on any input of size N regardless of order.\\
Insertion sort takes longer depending on how far each item is from its initial position. Given a list of size N, insertion sort will run fastest if it is already sorted and slowest if the items are in reverse order (as far from sorted as possible).
