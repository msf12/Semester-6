% 1. Given an LLRB, is there exactly one corresponding 2-3 tree? Given a 2-3 tree, is the exactly one corresponding LLRB?
% 2. Draw a 2-3 tree with all 3 nodes. Why is the height log3(N)?
% 3. How many compares does it take in the worst case to decide whether to take the left, middle, or right link from a 3 node?

\paragraph{\Large 1. Study Guide Question}\mbox{}\\
Given an LLRB, is there exactly one corresponding 2-3 tree? Given a 2-3 tree, is the exactly one corresponding LLRB?\\

2-3 trees and LLRBs have an exact 1-1 correspondence. For any 2-3 tree there is exactly one LLRB tree and vice versa.

\paragraph{\Large 2. Study Guide Question}\mbox{}\\
Draw a 2-3 tree with all 3 nodes. Why is the height log3(N)?\\

\Tree [ .{1 2} [ .{3 4} {9 10} {11 12} {13 14} ] [ .{5 6} {15 16} {17 18} {19 20} ] [ .{7 8} {21 22} {23 24} {25 26} ] ]\\
Each node of the tree has 3 children, leading to a height of $\left \lceil{\log_3{N}}\right \rceil$

\paragraph{\Large 3. Study Guide Question}\mbox{}\\
How many compares does it take in the worst case to decide whether to take the left, middle, or right link from a 3 node?\\

It takes 2 compares in the worst case as eliminating 2 of the three children is all that is necessary to decide to take the third.

\paragraph{\Large 4. One of the following: Fall 2010 Midterm Question 4, Fall 2011 Midterm Question 6, Spring 2012 Midterm Question 5, Spring 2013 Midterm Question 2, Fall 2008 Midterm Question 6, Fall 2009 Midterm Question 4}\mbox{}\\
